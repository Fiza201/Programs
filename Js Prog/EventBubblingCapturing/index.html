<!-- 
  Event Bubbling:- 
  Event bubbling means that the events will have a tendency of bubble out so in this html structure if we click
  child, then the event will bubble out to parent div then from parent div it will bubble out to grandparent div  

  Event Tickering: 
  Event Tickering means events will penetrate inside the html skeleton, means if we click the GrandParent div, then the event will
  ticker to the Parent div then it will ticker to the child div.

  These Bubbling and Tickering will continue to happen along with the events we need to decide that by which way we need to capture them
